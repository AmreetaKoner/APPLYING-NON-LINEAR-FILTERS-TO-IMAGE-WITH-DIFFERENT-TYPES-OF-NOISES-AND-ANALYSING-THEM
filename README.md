# APPLYING-NON-LINEAR-FILTERS-TO-IMAGE-WITH-DIFFERENT-TYPES-OF-NOISES-AND-ANALYSING-THEM
Image pixels get damaged with noises that occur due to transmission errors, malfunctioning pixel elements in the camera sensors, faulty memory locations, and timing errors in analog-to-digital conversion. Our aim is to compare removal of various types of noises along with standard averaging ﬁlters and a hybrid median ﬁlter. We will be demonstrating that hybrid median ﬁlter provides best ﬁltering for taken images. For all window ﬁlters there is some problem. That is edge treating. If you place window over an element at the edge, some part of the window will be empty. To ﬁll the gap, signal should be extended. For this purpose, we have to perform various pre-processing operations to extend the image.
